# we use deque here because if we want to erase the first data then all the other datas present have to change
# the position which creates adverse effect on the performance. for example if you have 1001 item in in a list and
# you have to remove the first item the other 1000 items have to change their place in the memory
# queues is another data structures which works of FIFO principle
